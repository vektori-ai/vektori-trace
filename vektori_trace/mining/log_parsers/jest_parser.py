"""Jest output parser.

Jest's default reporter prints per-test status lines using Unicode glyphs:

    PASS  src/foo.test.ts
      Foo
        ✓ returns 200 (4 ms)
        ✕ returns 500 (1 ms)

    FAIL  src/bar.test.ts
      Bar > nested describe
        ✓ does the thing (12 ms)
        ○ skipped: tagged xit

    Tests:       2 failed, 4 passed, 1 skipped, 7 total

We reconstruct the qualified test name from the surrounding `describe` /
file scope by tracking indentation:

    file      = "src/foo.test.ts"
    describe  = ["Foo"]
    test_name = "src/foo.test.ts > Foo > returns 200"

This is enough to compute FAIL_TO_PASS / PASS_TO_PASS because the same name
appears in both pre- and post-fix runs of `validate_pr`.

Glyph legend:
  ✓ / √ / "PASS"  → PASSED
  ✕ / × / "FAIL"  → FAILED
  ○ / "skipped"   → SKIPPED

Mocha (the other common JS runner) uses the same ✓/✕ glyphs, so this parser
covers most mocha output too. Vitest's default reporter is jest-compatible
by design — also covered.
