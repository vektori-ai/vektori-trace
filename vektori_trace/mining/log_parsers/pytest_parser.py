"""Pytest output parser.

Pytest emits per-test status lines in TWO formats, depending on flags:

  1. Verbose progress (pytest -v):
       tests/test_foo.py::test_a PASSED                                 [25%]
       tests/test_foo.py::test_b FAILED                                 [50%]

  2. Short summary (always, at end of run):
       PASSED tests/test_foo.py::test_a
       FAILED tests/test_foo.py::test_b - AssertionError: ...

The earlier version of this parser only handled format (2), so with `-v`
output (the progress lines that come first) it returned an empty map.
We now match both — progress lines AND summary lines — and last-write-wins
so a test that progress-printed PASSED then re-appeared in the summary
still ends up as PASSED.

    Notes:
      - Last-write-wins. A test that appears in both progress AND summary
        ends up as whichever appeared last (typically summary, which is fine).
      - SKIPPED lines like `SKIPPED [1] tests/foo.py:42` have the [N] count
        prefix stripped so the test name is the third token, not '[1]'.
      - Lines like `FAILED tests/foo.py::test_x - AssertionError: ...`
        get the dash chunk stripped to keep the test name clean.
      - Returns an empty dict for empty/malformed input. Caller decides what
        to do; usually treat as "test suite didn't run, env issue".
