"""Go test (`go test -v`) output parser.

Go's verbose test output uses unambiguous marker lines:

    === RUN   TestParseConfig
        ... test body output ...
    --- PASS: TestParseConfig (0.00s)
    === RUN   TestBrokenInput
    --- FAIL: TestBrokenInput (0.01s)
        parse_test.go:42: expected 5, got 6
    === RUN   TestSkippedForNow
    --- SKIP: TestSkippedForNow (0.00s)
        only_on_linux.go:11: skipping on darwin
    PASS
    ok      github.com/foo/bar    0.013s

For subtests, the indentation increases:

    --- PASS: TestParse (0.00s)
        --- PASS: TestParse/valid_input (0.00s)
        --- FAIL: TestParse/invalid_input (0.00s)

We treat the leading `---` line as the source of truth — its status keyword
is the test's outcome, regardless of indentation depth. The test name is
the second token (`TestName/subname` for subtests). Last-write-wins keeps
the lifecycle simple: re-runs of the same test (e.g. `-count=N`) end up
with whichever status came last.
