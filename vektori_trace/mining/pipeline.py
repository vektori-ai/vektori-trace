"""Sandbox-verified PR mining (SWE-bench-style).

For each merged PR within scope:
  1. Pull metadata + unified diff via `gh pr list` / `gh pr diff`
  2. Split the diff into `patch` (source files) and `test_patch` (test files)
     using the same keyword-on-path heuristic SWE-bench uses
  3. If validation enabled: run the bootstrap container twice (once with
     test_patch only, once with both patches) to compute FAIL_TO_PASS and
     PASS_TO_PASS sets — the verified oracle
  4. Emit a Harbor task with environment/Dockerfile (FROM <bootstrap_image>),
     tests/test.sh (the eval script), and solution/patch.diff (gold patch)

Unlike `pr_diff`, this pipeline requires a working Docker image from the
bootstrap phase. `cmd_generate` triggers `ensure_bootstrap()` automatically
when `requires_bootstrap=True`.

  (Zhang et al., NIPS '25, arXiv:2505.23419)
  https://github.com/microsoft/SWE-bench-Live   (MIT)

We adapt the patch-split heuristic (collect/utils.py:extract_patches),
the eval-script structure (harness/test_spec/utils.py:make_eval_script_list_common),
and the F2P/P2P grading semantics (harness/grading.py). No code is copied;
we don't depend on the `swebench` PyPI package.

    Diffed against `base_ref`, not the index. `git diff --cached` is
    staged-vs-HEAD, and agents commit: Claude Code and Codex both run
    `git commit` unprompted on a bugfix. Once they do, HEAD moves, the diff
    comes out empty, and a correct solution is scored as a loss — then handed
    to the diagnosis as a losing trace to explain, which is the failure mode
    the ATIF and infra-failure work exists to eliminate. Against a fixed base
    ref, committed, staged and unstaged work all appear alike.

    `git add -A` still runs first: untracked files are invisible to `git diff`
    at any ref, so an agent that fixes a bug by adding a module would have its
    work silently dropped.

    The agent can tamper with this: it runs in their container, and they could
    shadow `git`. That's acceptable, because the *scoring* doesn't. The worst a
    forged diff achieves is being applied to a clean repo and tested honestly —
    to score, it still has to actually fix the code. Patching the tests doesn't
    work either: test.sh resets test files to base and re-applies the hidden
    test_patch after this lands.

    HTML comments are dropped first. PR templates routinely *instruct* the
    author inside a comment block — pydantic's says
    `<!-- please use "fix #123" style references -->` — and matching that
    boilerplate linked every such PR to issue #123. The task then took its
    problem statement from an unrelated issue, which is worse than skipping the
    PR: the corpus looks fine and the instruction describes a different bug.
    GitHub does not close anything from inside a comment either, so the text
    carries no reference to find.

    `repo` is the `(owner, name)` being mined, and the URL spelling is only
    honoured when it points at that repo. An issue number is meaningless on its
    own: the caller feeds it to `fetch_issue(owner, name, n)` against the *mined*
    repo, so a cross-repo reference —

        Fixes https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-core/issues/1234

    in a `prefecthq/prefect` PR — resolves to `prefecthq/prefect#1234`, a real
    but unrelated issue, whose text then becomes the task's problem statement.
    That is the same silent corruption as the PR-template case above: the corpus
    looks healthy and the instruction describes a different bug. Split-repo orgs
    make this routine (`pydantic/pydantic` ↔ `pydantic/pydantic-core`,
    `prefecthq/prefect` ↔ `prefecthq/prefect-*`).

    Passing `repo=None` skips the check and is for callers that only ask
    *whether* a link exists — but every such caller in this module has the repo
    to hand, so `None` should stay a test-only convenience.

    Scans all matches rather than only the first: a body may cite another repo's
